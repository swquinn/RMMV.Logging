rmmv-logging (0.1-alpha)
========================

## Introduction
Logging for RPG Maker MV (or _Logging_ for short) is a plugin that creates an
abstraction around different logging paradigms. It is designed to allow logging
to different handlers (e.g. console, file, etc.) to give more flexibility during
development.

## Features
Logging currently provides two handlers: a **console** log handler, and a **file**
log handler. Both are enabled by default.

## Author's Notes
This project started as a means of getting reliable logging into my project
without launching the game in a browser and without using JavaScript alerts.
After finishing the plugin with console and file handling support I discovered
that the stand alone client, launched from within the RPG Maker MV editor,
has access to the Webkit developer tools component by hitting **F8** from within
the game.

The Logging plugin is still useful, if only as a demonstration of the fact that
NodeJS modules are available to your game.
